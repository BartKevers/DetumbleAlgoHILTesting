# DetumbleAlgoHILTesting
 python and matlab files for HIL test of the detumble algo

run the ADCS_sim.m, make sure the path of the python file AlgoHILTest.py is correct
in PQ9Client.py, make sure the correct address and port are used.

plots for ~1000 seconds HIL test are included in the plots folder.
they show that the tumble parameter is decreasing. 
longer tests are still required to actual verify that it eventually detumbles
